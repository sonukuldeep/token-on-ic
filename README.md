# Create your own token in IC

Dfinity v0.18.0 and Reactjs v18.2.0

## Intro
The DFINITY Foundation is a major contributor to the Internet Computer blockchain.

## This repo follows Angella Yu's udemy course
Lesson 424-434 and each branch is a chapter from her course.

This repo uses updated packages and maybe different slightly from the tutorial so as fix certain compactibility issues

## How to make it work?
1. Install Nodejs v16.0.0 or higher.
2. Follow [this link](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/tutorials/deploy_sample_app#step-1-install-the-internet-computer-ic-sdk) and install Internet computer SDK if you dont already have it.
1. Clone this repo to your machine
2. cd into project folder
4. Run `dfx start` on a seperate terminal
3. Run `npm i` to install all packages
5. Run `dfx deploy` to generate all canisters and configurations
5. Finally run `npm start` and open http://localhost:8080 on browser

Enjoy :)

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
